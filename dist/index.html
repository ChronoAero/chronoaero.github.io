      Hello, unfortunately, I decided to take down the content of this website temporarily...
    </p>
    <p>
      <div>I plan to work on it during breaks while studying for finals :3 and maybe this summer holiday</div>
      <div>I was thinking that I should update some information about myself and add more features to this site...</div>
    </p>
    <p>
      I'll see you later :)
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>I will be testing and work on the page down here</p>
    <p>You can check the progress, or simply ignore me hehe :)</p>

    <div
      x-data="{
        query: new URLSearchParams(location.search).get('q')
      }"
    >
      <h3>Read Query Parameter Demo</h3>
      <p class="mb-2">
        location.search: "<span x-text="location.search"></span>"
      </p>
      <p>
        Param "q" (from URL): "<span x-text="query"></span>"
      </p>
      <p>Some sample links with "q" in the URL:
        <a href="?q=my search">my search</a>,
        <a href="?q=another search">another search</a>,
        <a href="?q=">reset</a>
      </p>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
